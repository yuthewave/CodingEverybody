      ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI that generates human-like text responses. 
      It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, trained on a large amount of text data to understand and produce natural language. 
      Users can interact with ChatGPT for tasks like answering questions, drafting emails, or brainstorming ideas. 
      It uses patterns in the data it has been trained on to provide relevant, context-aware responses. 
      ChatGPT is widely used for both professional and casual conversations, offering assistance in a variety of topics.
