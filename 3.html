      Copilot, developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, is an AI-powered code assistant designed to help developers write code more efficiently. 
      It is built on OpenAI's Codex model and integrates directly into code editors like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, and others. 
      Copilot suggests code snippets, auto-completes lines, and offers solutions based on the context of the code you're writing. 
      It supports multiple programming languages and can help with tasks like debugging, learning new frameworks, or building projects faster. 
      By reducing repetitive tasks and providing smart recommendations, Copilot enhances productivity for developers of all skill levels.
